# Ingredient-Meal-Nutrition-Checker

Enter an ingredient or meal of your choice and select the health concern you are trying to address. 
Using the fda's public API, it grabs the necessary nutritional facts that determines whether you 
should avoid the selected item or not based on your health concerns. 

For example, selecting "Heart Healthy" as your concern for high cholesterol and searching "ice cream"
will give you the exact measurement of cholesterol and fat for ice cream from the FDA database, and 
advise that you stay away from it as it contains a high amount of fat and cholesterol.

This was my hackathon project, and first introduction to implementing HTML/CSS/JavaScript into my 
own developed website, as well as my first ever use of API calls using it to fetch data from a 
database in JSON form.
